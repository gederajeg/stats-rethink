# Overview

A practice note for McElreath's [-@mcelreath2020] *Statistical Rethinking*.

### 2.1.1 Counting possibilities

-   a bag with marbles

    -   4 marbles ‚úÖ

    -   2 colours: blue and white ‚úÖ

    -   QUESTION: how many marbles there are for each colour? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

        -   **possibilities** (or "conjectures" [@mcelreath2020, 21]) of configuration of a given colour of the marbles:

            1.  all 4 marbles are white (total 4 marbles)

            2.  1 marble is blue and 3 marbles are white (total 4 marbles)

            3.  2 marbles are blue and 2 marbles are white (total 4 marbles)

            4.  3 marbles are blue and 1 marble is white (total 4 marbles)

            5.  all 4 marbles are blue (total 4 marbles)

    -   GOAL: which of those five possibilities/conjectures is most plausible, *given* "some **evidence** about the contents of the bag" [@mcelreath2020, 21, boldface mine].

        -    the "evidence": data of pulling out a sequence of three marbles, "one at a time, replacing the marble each time and shaking the bag before drawing another marble" [@mcelreath2020, 21].

            -   the "evidence": 2 blues and 1 white

```{r}
ways <- c( 0 , # conjecture/possibility 1
           3 , # conjecture/possibility 2
           8 , # conjecture/possibility 3
           9 , # conjecture/possibility 4
           0   # conjecture/possibility 5
)
ways/sum(ways)
```

## 2.3 Components of the Model

### 2.3.1 Variables

- target of inference: 

    - *p* (the proportion of *water* on the globe)
    
    - this *p* cannot be observed
    
    - **unobserved variable** = **PARAMETER**
    
    - *p* is **un**observed, BUT, can be *inferred* from another variable, the **observed variable**
    
- observed variable:

    - counts of *water* (*W*) and *land* (*L*)
